I‚Äôm not really a photo kinda guy but I‚Äôm worried that with taking the ‚Äúnormal amount‚Äù of pictures im gonna fall short on the 128gb.

Syke, moved up from the 12 mini to the 13 mini aka the greatest phone of all time. Slapped apple care on this and now I‚Äôm never moving on. Bury me with this phone when my time comes",-6,1694862503,20230709
