I was invited probably like many others for early access to Apple Pay Later. 

I inquired with support to get more information about how trade-ins affect your payments. This is the answer I received!

Via Apple Support: 

**”Upon checking here, if you use the Apple Pay Later and trade in your device, the trade in value will be credited instantly on the purchase since you'll be paying it overtime.**

**However, it'll still subject to change the trade in value.**

**Apple will email you if the price will change or the value will be fixed and no other adjustment must be done. You need to accept the offer so Apple will credit the trade in value.**

**s long as you're device is in good condition, I'm sure there will be no changes with the trade in value.**


If you’re unsure if you’ve been invited for early access to this new payment method, just open the wallet app and click the plus button.
